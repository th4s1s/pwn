Granulizer - the new state-of-the-art granular synthesizer filter!

# Usage
Upload a .wav or .pcm file, set some options, granulize it, download and play it on your computer.
Or use the client/ for having a GUI.
The .wav file should be small, mono audio and only have a bit depth of 8bit / 16bit. You can also use the preshipped audio files in the client, 'space.wav' and 'bach.wav' for experimenting.
